# Chapter 1: Basic Conversation

In Hach, there is normal words, and less complex words.

Sometimes, the translators will struggle, so you'd need to know how to interpret different forms of the same sentence.

> *for example, "eu" and "oi" are the same thing, they both mean "You",*
> *Originally, "oi" was the first version of "you" in hach. Eventually,*
> *future revisions made the "you" word easier to deal with.*
> *For historical purposes, `oi` will remain in Hach.*

## SWTSTST

SWTSTST - Same Way To Say The Same Thing

The "Same Way To Say The Same Thing" principle, is in the order that most words will have other words, that mean the same thing.

In Hach, `ichen` means **I'm (I am)**, while `aie ime`, or `aie'm` also means **I am**.

Marketplace in Hach is **markplatz**, while you can also create a similar word with `ietzhattz`, which is a combo
of the words `ietz (item)` and `hattz (house)`, which would make `Item House`, to be interpreted as a Shop, or, a Marketplace.

In german, this is similar to the words such as *Antibabypillen*, in the terms that words are combined to form a single word;
that is a description of multiple things, *a combination*.

In hach, a way to say the full language's name "Hachnzen", is by using the "hac" abbreviation. It will always be interpreted as the full name.

## Basic Conversation Example

A basic conversation would look like:

```

Person1: hezcr!

Person2: hezcr!

Person1: hi, hao st eu?

Person2: ichen gued, hao abut eu?

Person1: oah, wea dit iset cuel!

```

> *"Hezcr" is the most basic form of a greeting. It means "hello" in english :)*

Translated:

```

Person1: Hello!

Person2: Hello!

Person1: Hi, how are you?

Person2: I'm good, how about you?

Person1: Oh, well that's cool!

```

For most of the words in Hach, they sometimes sound the same as their english counterpart.

`hao` - How

`abut` - About

`eu` - You

> *And yes, Hach uses an english-style punctuation, you don't need to use any fancy symbols.*
