# Translating 

For research purposes, translator binaries may be released soon, but click
[here](Translation-Issues.md) to find out why learning the language is better than using
any translator.

## Basic dialect

You can write sentences and have a translator output. Example:

```

>> well that is cool
wea dit iset cuel
>> Okay, how do I learn Hachnzen? 
okai, hao do aie lernten hac?
>> 

```
